### Who are we?
Originally started in 2018-2019 by Captainjamason and thouuu; We are an organization of like-minded individuals who like FOSS and interesting hardware.
Our goal is to make software/hardware we are proud of, along with having the opportunity to grow our own skillsets through what we do.
